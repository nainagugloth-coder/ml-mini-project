# ML Mini Project

A simple Machine Learning project using Linear Regression to predict student marks based on study hours.

## Problem Statement
Predict student marks based on the number of hours they study.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## ML Concepts Used
- Linear Regression
- Train-Test Split
- Model Evaluation (MAE, R² Score)
- Prediction using user input

## Files
- model.py → Model training, evaluation, and prediction
- data.csv → Dataset of study hours vs marks
- requirements.txt → Project dependencies

## How to Run

Install required libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
